			<p>But for the pandemic, I would be flying to New York City to see a snowy owl standing in a Central Park meadow. It‚Äôs the first time the Arctic tundra dweller has been seen in the park in130 years. ‚ÄúWow! A magnificent snowy owl is in NYC! ü¶â,‚Äù @Centralparknyc posted on IG.</p>

			<p>The rare sighting took me back to 2013, when I persuaded my husband to ditch his birthday dinner in favor of careening over to Marina del Rey to see blue-footed boobies that had appeared offshore. We got there just before sunset. Avid birders had set up scopes and invited us to take a look. It was beyond thrilling to see these visitors from Ecuador‚Äôs Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>

			<p>How did I know the boobies had arrived? I regularly scroll the Rare Bird Alert for L.A. County, an app that tracks out-of-place birds the way Hollywood tracks red-carpet arrivals. Each entry gives details on where to find the bird and how many times it has been seen. Last week, a scissor-tailed flycatcher, native to the southern Great Plains and south Texas, appeared at the Westside‚Äôs Ballona Wetlands ‚Äî more than once. A tropical kingbird, usually found between southern Arizona and Central America, turned up at Torrance‚Äôs Entradero Park. Download the eBird app here.</p>
